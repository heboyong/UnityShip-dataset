# UnityShip-dataset
## This is a repository for the dataset published in our paper: ***UnityShip***
#### Information about the paper will be posted after the paper has been accepted
1. The first large-scale synthetic dataset for ship object recognition and analysis in aerial images, UnityShips, was created. This dataset contains over 100 000 images and 194 054 example objects collected from 79 ship models in ten categories and six large virtual scenes with different weather, time of day, light intensity, and altitude settings. This dataset exceeds existing real-world ship recognition datasets in terms of the number of images and instances.
2. UnityShip contains horizontal bounding boxes, oriented bounding boxes, fine-grained category information, instance ID information, and scene information. It can be used for tasks such as horizontal object detection, rotated object detection, fine-grained recognition, re-identification, scene recognition, and other computer vision tasks.
